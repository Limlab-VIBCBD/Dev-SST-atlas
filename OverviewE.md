# Dev-SST-atlas
Code to build the SST+ interneuron atlas
There are 3 modules
  Module 1: This allows the user to download any single cell RNA seq dataset and isolate their cell population of interest. There are some built in QC to filter out the low quality cells
  Module 2: This module determine if datasets from different sources are integrable. You need to set one dataset as the "base" atlas. 
  Module 3: Integration of all datasets that pass thhe integrable criteria.
